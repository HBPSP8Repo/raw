# Worker node
Worker node developed in python to use with raw-ldb.
It offers web services  querying, registering files and listing schemas.


## Dependencies 
You need to have already installed ldb first located at:
* LDB database (https://github.com/raw-db/ldb)

You can also install a scala executer with the option to use Spark located at:
* RAW (https://github.com/raw-db/raw)

## Running

You will need to define 2 environment variables
* SHORE_DATA :  path where you want to save the database files for your users
* LDB_HOME path :  to the installation of LDB

You can edit at env.sh with the paths and then type
```
source env.sh
```

then just type 
```
python server.py -c
```

Remember that if you want to run the ldb executables manually you will need to add the environment variable LDBCONFIG 
poiting to your ldb config file of your user, generated by the python executable.
So for instance to run an "odl format" command you will need to run it like this:
```
LDBCONFIG=$SHORE_DATA/123456789-john_doe/ldbconfig $LDB_HOME/bin/odl format
```
